# HW3_Question1
The code builds a fully connected autoencoder using TensorFlow/Keras to reconstruct MNIST images. It preprocesses the data, defines an encoder (784→32) and decoder (32→784), compiles and trains the model with binary cross-entropy loss, and visualizes original vs. reconstructed images. Users can modify the latent dimension for analysis.
